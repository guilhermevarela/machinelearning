	Models page rank as a markov model:
	*M webpages 
	*page .: state
	*visits .: sequence
	*link .: vote for page's importance
	*A[i,j]= 1/n[i] if i links to j else 0
	*A[i,j] .: Markov matrix .: it's rows sum to 1
	*n[i] total of links on page i (sum of rows is n[i] / n[i] == 1)
	
	But, Is the limiting distribution unique?
	* 1910 Perron-Frobenius	(PF) .: 
		if we have a markov matrix (all rows sum to 1),
		all values are strictly positives (none are zeros), 
		then the stationary distribution exists and is unique 

	How to satisfy PF?
		*Use smoothing .: give zeros a small probability .:
			*U ~ 1/M (U MxM)
			*G= 0.85A + 0.15U
