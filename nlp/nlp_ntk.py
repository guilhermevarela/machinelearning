POS tagging 
EX Bob is great ->(noun, verb, adjective)
full table			https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html

Stemming and lemmatizing
Both reduce the word to a base form.
Stemmers only truncate
Lemmatizers adjust to the right radical
stem('wolves')  -> wolv
lemmatize('wolves')  -> wolf

NER (Named entity recognition)
What "are" the entities
"Albert Einstein" -> person
"Apple" 		  -> Organization
